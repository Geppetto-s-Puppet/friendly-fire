-- [Database Status]
-- Currently, variables are stored in an SQLite database file instead of CSV.
-- Path: ./plugins/Skript/variables.db

-- [Future Plans]
-- While I'm using SQLite for now as a simpler alternative to CSV,
-- I'm considering migrating to a full MySQL/MariaDB environment in the future
-- for better scalability and multi-server synchronization.
