# 毒入りの食べ物生成する能力を送れ

#   参加者はいずれかのトランプに割り当てられ、他スートを殲滅すれば勝ち。
#   割り当ては被らず、一匹狼のジョーカーを含めて最大53人プレイ(13×4+1)。
#   トランプアイテムは入手したりもできるが、割り当てられたチームは固定。
#   他プレイヤーが敵か仲間かを推測する方法は、基本的に下記の四つ。
#   1.殺して直接確認。元も子もないが早い。アイテムは偽造できるため警戒。
#   2.会話による確認。状況判断が命。お互い開示せず終盤までの結託もアリ。
#   3.真実のシンボル。一番確実だが、このシンボル単独では戦闘力に欠ける。
#   4.コミットメント。殆ど脅迫だが、上手く使いこなせば仲間を炙り出せる。
# 中盤の立ち回り: |
#   信用しすぎはリスクだが、疑いすぎると孤立して、却って危ないため注意。
#   マップは広く、天候や昼夜も変わる。大抵、皆は市民や動物に紛れている。
#   ここで優先すべきは、勢力関係と、単独でヤバいシンボルが居るかの把握。
#   スートと同様、相手の能力も洞察するしかない。基本的に下記の四つ。
#   1.不自然な行動の確認。積極的な接近、やたら高所を取る、銃を捨てる等。
#   2.殺傷能力による余裕。リスキーな言動の背景には、たいてい自信が絡む。
#   3.退避や防衛は可能か。いわゆる"搦手"や"詰み"は、予想しとくしかない。
#   4.カウンターは可能か。敵を仕留めるには"素早い不意打ち"が最も効果的。
# 終盤の立ち回り: |
#   積極的なプレイヤーは、数々の戦利品からシンボルを回収しまくっている。
#   この際は、敵の誰かを懐柔する・交渉して延命させてもらうのも一つの手。
#   欺瞞、いじめ、裏切り、イカサマ、集団リンチ、なんでも起きるため注意。
#   ここまで理不尽に耐え抜いて、突如ゲームが終了したら……
#   おめでとう、君の勝ちだ。

# プロトタイプ版で実際にあった試合:
# - 序盤で装備を破棄し、能力を一切使わずに他の全員を殺害したプレイヤー
# - 二大勢力が結成され、激しい抗争をしたが、実は殆どクラブマークで味方
# - 双対のシンボルで、空を飛んでた飛行機と位置交換して逆転したプレイヤー
# - 重力のシンボルと彗星のシンボルが手を組み、即着弾する迫撃砲で蹂躙
# - 民間人を片っ端から殺して自殺する、イカれた行動原理のプレイヤー
# - シンボルで荒稼ぎをし、銀行や証券などを単独でダウンさせたプレイヤー
# - 不死のシンボル同士の果てしない消耗戦が続き、ガソスタの爆発で相打ち
# - 終盤まで無双してプレイヤーが、あっけなくオオカミのNPCに喰い殺される
# - VCでの罵詈雑言だけは禁止にしよう、という人権宣言が自発的に締結される
# - 弱い装備のプレイヤーらが、敵同士な事を承知した上で徒党を組んで大逆転
# - NANDゲート的な発動条件のシンボルを組み合わせ、電卓を作ったプレイヤー
# - 頻繁に裏切るプレイヤーは村八分にされ、序盤で死にやすい自浄作用
# - 電卓作ったプレイヤーがサーバーダウンさせる方法を編み出した(修正済み)
# 発見: |
#   直感的には、ボブのシンボルは最弱で、停止のシンボルのが勝率が高い
#   しかし三ヶ月間データを集計すると、その差はわずか最大0.1%しか無かった
#   むしろプレイヤー間での方が、勝率の違いが最大21%と顕著だったのである
#   つまり、上手いプレイヤーは何を持たせても上手く立ち回るという事が判明
#   これを知った製作者は、「現実でも同じ事が起きてるのでは？」と考えた
#   短期的な試合結果だけ見れば、確かに運や情報に左右される部分も大きい
#   ではなぜ、環境に不平不満を垂らすだけのプレイヤーの“勝率が低い”のか？
#   製作者はこの現象に名前を付けた、“敗者のシンボル”と。

# ゲーム概要: |
#   「もしも能力バトルが現実にあったら」を体現した、バトルロワイヤル！
#   タイトルは『ANOMATROL』で、既に三ヶ月間のβテストに成功済み！
# 序盤の立ち回り: |
#   まずはランダムな食料・銃器・近接武器・シンボル・トランプが配られる。
#   参加者はいずれかのトランプに割り当てられ、他スートを殲滅すれば勝ち。
#   割り当ては被らず、一匹狼のジョーカーを含めて最大53人プレイ(13×4+1)。
#   トランプアイテムは入手したりもできるが、割り当てられたチームは固定。
#   他プレイヤーが敵か仲間かを推測する方法は、基本的に下記の四つ。
#   1.殺して直接確認。元も子もないが早い。アイテムは偽造できるため警戒。
#   2.会話による確認。状況判断が命。お互い開示せず終盤までの結託もアリ。
#   3.真実のシンボル。一番確実だが、このシンボル単独では戦闘力に欠ける。
#   4.コミットメント。殆ど脅迫だが、上手く使いこなせば仲間を炙り出せる。
# 中盤の立ち回り: |
#   信用しすぎはリスクだが、疑いすぎると孤立して、却って危ないため注意。
#   マップは広く、天候や昼夜も変わる。大抵、皆は市民や動物に紛れている。
#   ここで優先すべきは、勢力関係と、単独でヤバいシンボルが居るかの把握。
#   スートと同様、相手の能力も洞察するしかない。基本的に下記の四つ。
#   1.不自然な行動の確認。積極的な接近、やたら高所を取る、銃を捨てる等。
#   2.殺傷能力による余裕。リスキーな言動の背景には、たいてい自信が絡む。
#   3.退避や防衛は可能か。いわゆる"搦手"や"詰み"は、予想しとくしかない。
#   4.カウンターは可能か。敵を仕留めるには"素早い不意打ち"が最も効果的。
# 終盤の立ち回り: |
#   積極的なプレイヤーは、数々の戦利品からシンボルを回収しまくっている。
#   この際は、敵の誰かを懐柔する・交渉して延命させてもらうのも一つの手。
#   欺瞞、いじめ、裏切り、イカサマ、集団リンチ、なんでも起きるため注意。
#   ここまで理不尽に耐え抜いて、突如ゲームが終了したら……
#   おめでとう、君の勝ちだ。
